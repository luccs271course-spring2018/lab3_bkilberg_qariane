### TestIterator and TestList
#### Try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
It doesnâ€™t make any difference with a linkedlist all the test  run.


### TestIterator
#### What happens if you use list.remove(77)?
It  will throw an error because it is basically asking to  remove  the value at index 77.


### TestList 
#### what does this method do? list.remove(5)
We are removing data at index 5


#### what does this one do? list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5));
We are removing the data object of the integer 5

#### which of the two lists performs better as the size increases? 
The Array list preforms better when we access elements , but linked lists perform better when being added or removed.
